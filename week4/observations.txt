15puzzzle.cpp :

to check if handle is used or not in class MyButton i have added a variable of type 
bool to check if is used or not.

For checking if the buttons are adjacent or not i have added two more
index_x and index_y 
and if the sum of absolute difference of indexes of x and y is equal to 1 then only the conditon executes.

It runs continuously because of for loop and if we close the fltk window it stops

But don't know why i am not getting window but it is compiling with no errors and warnings.
Can you check it why
